## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

First, create labels for your points
```{r cars}
popup = c("Robin", "Jakub", "Jannes")
summary(cars)
```
Next, you create a Leaflet map with these basic steps: 
call the leaflet() function and pipe in some background maps ("tiles"), 
and then addMarker() function with longitude and latitude.
Run the pipeline below to see the result:
Including Plots
```{r}
leaflet() %>%                                 # create a map widget by calling the leaflet library
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldPhysical") %>%  # add Esri World Physical map tiles explicitly
  addAwesomeMarkers(lng = c(-3, 23, 11),      # add point markers specified with longitude for 3 points
                    lat = c(52, 53, 49),      # and latitude for 3 points (coordinates fall in EU)
                    popup = popup)  
```

#Example 2: create a Leaflet map of Sydney with the setView() function

Note that there are no points or markers below, just background tiles. setView() function
alone helps you focus and zoom the map in a particular area of the world.

Now we are in Sydney
```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%                              # add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery",       # add custom Esri World Physical map tiles
                   options = providerTileOptions(opacity=0.5)) %>%     # make the Esri tile transparent
  setView(lng = 151.005006, lat = -33.9767231, zoom = 10)              # set the location of the map 
```
Question 1: What is the order of longitude and latitude in the setView() function?
The first thing is longitude and the second one is latitude

Now let's go back to Europe again
When the map defined below renders, click the box in top right corner in your map Viewer to select between different background layers

```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  setView( lng = 2.34, lat = 48.85, zoom = 5 ) %>%  # let's use setView to navigate to our area
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldPhysical", group = "Physical") %>%  # add physical background
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery", group = "Aerial") %>%  # add satellite image
  addProviderTiles("MtbMap", group = "Geo") %>%               # add geomorphic units map
    
addLayersControl(                                 # we are adding layers control to the maps
  baseGroups = c("Geo","Aerial", "Physical"),
  options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = T))  # replace T with F and back and run it
```

Question 2: How does the map above change if you replace the T in the last line of code above with F?
If we replace T with F the layers option will always be open. If we run it with T we have to mark it in order to open and then change the layers.

#Example 3:  SYDNEY HARBOUR DISPLAY WITH 11 LAYERS
Let's create a map with more background layers that allows interactive selection between multiple layers. This can be useful if you want to rendering historical maps illustrating change over time

The chunk below sets the location and zoom level of your map
```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  setView(151.2339084, -33.85089, zoom = 13) %>%
  addTiles()  # checking I am in the right area
```

Bring in a choice of Esri background layers 

Create a basic base map

```{r}
l_aus <- leaflet() %>%   # assign the base location to an object
  setView(151.2339084, -33.85089, zoom = 13) 
```

Now, prepare to select backgrounds by grabbing their names
```{r}
esri <- grep("^Esri", providers, value = TRUE)
```

Select backgrounds from among provider tiles. To view the options, go to https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/ 
Run the following three lines together!

```{r}
for (provider in esri) {
  l_aus <- l_aus %>% addProviderTiles(provider, group = provider)
}
```

Map of Sydney, NSW, Australia
We make a layered map out of the components above and write it to an object called AUSmap
```{r}
AUSmap <- l_aus %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479") %>% 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
                        function(el, x) {
                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',
                        function (e) {
                        myMap.minimap.changeLayer(L.tileLayer.provider(e.name));
                        })
                        }") %>% 
addControl("", position = "topright")

```
run this to see your product
```{r}
AUSmap
```
#SAVE THE FINAL PRODUCT
Save map as a html document (optional, replacement of pushing the export button) only works in root

We will also need this widget to make pretty maps:
```{r}
saveWidget(AUSmap, "AUSmap.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
```

#TASK NUMBER ONE
Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with Esri layers, but call it DANmap. You will need it layer as a background for Danish data points.

#ADD DATA TO LEAFLET
Before you can proceed to Task 2, you need to learn about coordinate creation. 
In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial data from GoogleMaps, load these into R, and display them in Leaflet with addMarkers():

First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1
Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 
Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
IMPORTANT: watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number that corresponds to the account you wish to use.

Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)
```
If you experience difficulty with your read_sheet() function (it is erroring out), 
uncomment and run the following function:
gs4_deauth()  # run this line and then rerun the read_sheet() function below
```{r}
gs4_deauth()
```
Read in the Google sheet you've edited
```{r}
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlxsPElZML8LZKyXbqdAYeQCDIvDps2McZx1cTVWSzI/edit#gid=124710918",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc",   # check that you have the right number and type of columns
                     range = "DM2023")  # select the correct worksheet name
glimpse(places) 
```
Question 3: are the Latitude and Longitude columns present?
Yes
Do they contain numeric decimal degrees?
Yes

 If your coordinates look good, see how you can use addMarkers() function to
 load them in a basic map. Run the lines below and check: are any points missing? Why?
```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description, "<br>", places$Type))
```
Now that you have learned how to load points from a googlesheet to a basic leaflet map, apply the know-how to YOUR DANmap object. 
```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  setView(8.904098, 56.2019946, zoom = 6) %>%
  addTiles()

DANmap1 <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(8.904098, 56.2019946, zoom = 6) %>%
  addTiles()

DANmap1

esri <- grep("^Esri", providers, value = TRUE)

for (provider in esri) {
  DANmap1 <- DANmap1 %>% addProviderTiles(provider, group = provider)
}


DANmap <- DANmap1 %>%
  addLayersControl(baseGroups = names(esri),
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)) %>%
  addMiniMap(tiles = esri[[1]], toggleDisplay = TRUE,
             position = "bottomright") %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479") %>% 
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
                        function(el, x) {
                        var myMap = this;
                        myMap.on('baselayerchange',
                        function (e) {
                        myMap.minimap.changeLayer(L.tileLayer.provider(e.name));
                        })
                        }") %>% 
  addControl("", position = "topright")

DANmap
```
#TASK TWO
Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues created into your DANmap object (with 11 background layers you created in Task 1).
```{r}
DANmap_places <- DANmap %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description, "<br>", places$Type),clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
DANmap_places
```

#TASK THREE
Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet?
Hint: Google "clustering options in Leaflet in R"
Solution:
```{r}
DANmap_places <- DANmap %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description,
                           "<br>", places$Type,
                           places$Placename),clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
DANmap_places 
```

#TASK FOUR
Task 4: Look at the two maps (with and without clustering) and consider what each is good for and what not.
Your brief answer:
The first map can gives us a very precise indication where to find the different points on the map
However it is more difficult to get a overview over where many spots are grouped closely together.
This can be made with clustering but it also comes with the problem, that you loose a more detailed overview of specific spots on the map.

#TASK FIVE
Task 5: Find out how to display the notes and classifications column in the map. 
Hint: Check online help in sites such as https://r-charts.com/spatial/interactive-maps-leaflet/#popup

Solution:
```{r}
DANmap_places <- DANmap %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = paste(places$Description,
                           "<br>", places$Type,
                           places$Placename),clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
DANmap_places 



saveWidget(DANmap_places, "DANmap.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
```
CONGRATULATIONS - YOUR ARE DONE :)
